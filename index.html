      <h1>The Issue</h1>
      <p>China has been the main issue on media. With the ideas of similar movies, logos, etc.
        This is a plagiarism in their part of copying or getting ideas from America (obviously).</p>
      <section>
        <h1>Resolution</h1>
        <p>China gets a BRAIN, and stop trying to get ideas from U.S. I mean China is another country aside from Japan, with advanced technology
        like their high performance commute train, Donghai bridge, which is the longest bridge that goes across the sea in China, and so much others
        Why China? Why did you have to do this? Your only hurting your own country.</p>
